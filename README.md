# rt11-macxx
These are the sources to the RT11 version of MACXX used by Atari in the years ~1977 until around 1985.

Use whatever tool you have at your disposal (see the rtpip repository) to put these files into a container and run RT11-SJ or RT11-FB via SIMH.
Build all the assemblers with @BATALL.

Good luck.
